**DeepFashion** is a large-scale fashion image dataset that contains over 800,000 diverse fashion images ranging from well-posed shop images to unconstrained consumer photos.

We use part of DeepFashion to implement our editing system.

DeepFashion can be used to **train and evaluate algorithms of fashion retrieval, fashion synthesis, and GANs for fashion generation and editing**.
